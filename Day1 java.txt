1.Difference between compiler and interpreter

  COMPILER	
  1. Scans the entire program and translate it as a whole into machine code.
  2. It usually take large amount of time to analyse the source code.
  3. The overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.
  4. Generate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory.
  5. Examples : C, C++, Java

  INTERPRETER
  1. Translates one program statement at a time.
  2. It usually take less amount of time to analyse the source code.
  3. The overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers.
  4. No object code is generated, hence are memory efficient.
  5. Examples : Python, JavaScript, Ruby


2.Java program to create class Student and getting inputs and displaying it

  PROGRAM :
  import java.util.Scanner;
  class Student {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int roll;
        String name;
        float marks;
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter roll no : ");
        roll=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter name : ");
        name=sc.next();
        sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter marks : ");
        marks=sc.nextFloat();
        System.out.println("STUDENT DETAILS");
        System.out.println("Roll no : "+roll+"\nName : " + name + "\nMarks : "+marks);
    }
  }
