________________________________________________________

1. final Vs finally Vs finalize
	The basic difference between final, finally and finalize is that the final is an access modifier, finally is the block in Exception Handling and finalize is the method of object class.

   FINAL
	> final is the keyword and access modifier which is used to apply restrictions on a class, method or variable.
	> It is used with the classes, methods and variables.
	> Once declared, final variable becomes constant and cannot be modified,it cannot be overridden by sub class and cannot be inherited.
	> Final method is executed only when we call it.

   FINALLY
	> finally is the block in Java Exception Handling to execute the important code whether the exception occurs or not.
	> Finally block is always related to the try and catch block in exception handling.
	> finally block runs the important code even if exception occurs or not and it cleans up all the resources used in try block.
	> Finally block is executed as soon as the try-catch block is executed. It's execution is not dependant on the exception.

   FINALIZE
	> finalize is the method in Java which is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
	> finalize() method is used with the objects.
	> finalize method performs the cleaning activities with respect to the object before its destruction.
	> finalize method is executed just before the object is destroyed.
